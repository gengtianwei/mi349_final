    <p>The automobile, a wheeled road vehicle equipped with light power and self-propelled power, was not like this at the beginning of its invention, and the development of automobiles has also been a long process. After more than 100 years of continuous improvement and innovation, it has condensed human wisdom and ingenuity, and has benefited from the support of various industries such as petroleum, steel, aluminum, chemicals, plastics, machinery and equipment, electricity, road networks, electronic technology and finance. , Drove their development, and become the transportation tool with multiple types and different specifications that is widely used in various fields of social and economic life. Since 1970, the number of global cars has doubled almost every 15 years. In 2013, global car production was 87.38 million. It is predicted that by 2014, the number of cars worldwide will reach 1.2 billion.</p>

    <p class="p10">In 1896 Ford trial-produced the first car. In 1903, the Ford Motor Company was established. In the initial stage, a horse-drawn carriage manufacturer was leased as an assembly plant to assemble two A-type cars with a canopy boat body at a price of US$850. Engines, carburetors, transmissions, axles, and car bodies are all purchased. After building a new Bikai Appinho factory, a three-story factory building, with 18 large parts such as cylinder blocks and crankshafts on the first floor, small parts machined on the second floor, and final assembly on the third floor, it has the basic form of mass production.</p>
    <p class="p10">The diversification period of automobile products began in the 1950s to the 1970s, and until 1973 was the prime time for world automobile development. In the 1950s, the U.S. automobile industry has formed a situation where the three major companies of "General", "Ford" and "Chrysler" are in a state of dominance, and they dominate the world automobile market with overwhelming advantages. At the same time, European manufacturers also began to implement "mass production." In addition, European manufacturers have excellent product design performance, so as to produce all kinds of sports cars, and then sell them to the United States, resulting in the coexistence of Europe and the United States.</p>

    <p> On July 14, 1956, the "Jiefang" brand truck, the first car made by the Chinese themselves, was taken off the assembly line of the Changchun FAW. China's automobile industry started from then on, and the Chinese automobile industry started to talk. The source of interest. Over 50 years of ups and downs, Chinaâ€™s automobile industry has experienced a development experience from self-reliance to opening of the country, from scratch, from small to large, from birth to growth to maturity.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Behind the success of foreign auto giants in China is the huge sacrifice of the Chinese auto industry. In China, no industry is as dependent on the joint venture model as the auto industry. The rapid development of China's auto industry has not brought about the improvement of the competitiveness of the auto industry as expected. Due to the lack of independent brands and key technologies, and low Research and development capabilities, most of the core technologies of domestic automotive products are in the hands of joint ventures and have no right to speak. The traditional joint venture model of "trade market for technology" began to be questioned.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>There are historical reasons for taking the road of joint ventures, but independent brands and independent innovation are the ultimate goals of China's auto industry. During the two sessions this year and in the National Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the auto industry must rely on independent innovation to enhance the core competitiveness of Chinese auto industry enterprises. Participating in international competition has become a topic of focus.</p>
    <p>Looking back over the past fifty years, China's automobile industry has experienced several twists and turns. Now, with the strong support of national policies, China's automobile industry, which has gone through 50 years of ups and downs, is about to open a new chapter in history. Chery's 500,000th car rolled off the assembly line, which is also a milestone in the history of the national automobile industry.</p>
